Since there is something updated about the gradle. So there is a wrong during the compile with cordova.
Something like: cannot resolve "com.android_support_v4_version 27.+" 
and I found there is a plugin in the package.json related to the error. It is "android_support_v4_version 27.+".
And it's injected when I install the barcode-scanner.
So, search on google, there is a solution, it's to add a plugin like execute the bash:
"cordova plugin add cordova-android-support-gradle-release --variable ANDROID_SUPPORT_VERSION=24.+"
